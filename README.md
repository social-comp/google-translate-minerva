# google-translate-minerva


## Description

Python files for translating social media posts on Weibo using Google Cloud API, gathering covid-19 related posts, samples of data 

## googletranslate.py
* Information for setting up Google Cloud API translator:

1. `python -m venv env`
2. Set your shell to use the `venv` paths for Python by activating the virtual environment.

    ```
    source env/bin/activate

    ```

3. Now you can install packages without affecting other projects or your global Python installation

    ```
    pip install google-cloud-storage

    ```

4. Create a key in google cloud and download the json. Use the path of the json file and run this in terminal

```jsx
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/sophiawang/path/hazel-airlock-317718-a83f72e0427c.json"
```

If you want to stop using the virtual environment and go back to your global Python, you can deactivate it:

```
deactivate
```
